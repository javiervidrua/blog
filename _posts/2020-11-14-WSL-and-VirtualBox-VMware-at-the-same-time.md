If after installing *WSL2* on a system that had *VMware* or *VirtualBox* previously installed, you get an error that says something like this one:

![CredentialGuard](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi.stack.imgur.com%2FKxtXR.png&f=1&nofb=1 "CredentialGuard")

You just found that your system can't have *WSL2* and *VMware* or *VirtualBox* running at the same time, because *WSL2* uses the Hyper-V architecture for its virtualization, and some third party tools such as the mentioned before cannot work when Hyper-V is in use. 

At this point you might be thinking "**Wait, so you're telling me that I have to choose one or the other?!?!**"

The answer is "**No, but you'll have to choose one of three options**"

The options you have are those:
* Manually change which virtual machine plattform will be possible to use at a certain time.

  Open the Powershell as Administrator and run:

  If you want to enable *VMware*:
  ``` powershell
  bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype off
  ```

  If you want to enable *Hyper-V* and *WSL2*:
  ``` powershell
  bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype auto
  ```

  Big thanks to *Jesús Martín Juan* for fixing two typos. You can check this webpage [**here**](https://jesusemejota.github.io).

* Downgrade from *WSL2* to *WSL1*.

  As you may know, the first version of *WSL* is not a real kernel, instead, it acts as a translator from the *Linux* kernel to the *Windows* kernel. Thus, it is more limited than *WSL2*, but if you don't need any of the improvements that *WSL2* has over *WSL1*.

  You can downgrade your virtual machines to *WSL1* with the following command:
  ``` powershell
  wsl --set-version <distribution-name> 1
  ```

* Update *VMware* or *VirtualBox*.

  Many people have reached out to the developers since *WSL2* became available, and *Oracle* and *VMware* have developed their solutions for this problem.

  In case of *VMware*, they released the 15.5.6 version that solves this problem.
