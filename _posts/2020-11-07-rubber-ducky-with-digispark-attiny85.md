Do you want to have a [*Rubber Ducky*](https://shop.hak5.org/products/usb-rubber-ducky-deluxe) but you don't want to spend 50$ on it?

**How about spending 2$ on a *Digispark* and program it yourself?** If that sounds good, get your hands on one of those and follow these steps.

*Notice*: This tutorial is intended to be followed from a Windows 10 system.

## Get started
The first thing is installing the drivers. To do so, go to [**this**](https://github.com/digistump/DigistumpArduino/releases) link and download the installer. Both *32* and *64* bit architectures are supported.

Now you can stick the *Digispark ATtiny85* in a *USB* port and you should hear the Windows notification tone. Now if you go to the Device Manager, a new category named "*libusb-win32 Usb Devices*" should appear. That's good, now the system recognizes the *Digispark*.

## Configure the Arduino IDE
Go to [**this**](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) site and install the IDE, if you didn't have it already installed on your system.

Now we have to configure the IDE so it works with out Digispark:
* Open the IDE and go to *File* -> *Preferences*.
  
  In the field named "*Additional Boards Manager URLs*" enter the following line: 
  ```
  http://digistump.com/package_digistump_index.json
  ```
  As shown in the following image:
  
  ![AdditionalURLs](/blog/images/additionalurls.png "AdditionalURLs")
* Go to *Tools* -> *Boards* -> *Boards manager*:
  
  ![BoardsManager](/blog/images/boardsmanager.png "BoardsManager")
  
  Select "*Contributed*" from the drop-down menu and then install the "*Digistump AVR Boards*" package:

  ![AVRboards](/blog/images/avrboards.png "AVRboards")
* Now go to *Tools* -> *Boards* -> *Digistump AVR Boards* -> *Digispark (Default - 16.5 mhz)*:

  ![DigistumpDefault](/blog/images/digistumpdefault.png "DigistumpDefault")

## Test if it works
Create a new sketch and paste the following code:
```c
// Creates a digisparked text file in the Desktop

#include "DigiKeyboard.h"

void setup(){
}

void loop(){
  // Start
  DigiKeyboard.sendKeyStroke(0);
  DigiKeyboard.delay(300);
  // Open "Run"
  DigiKeyboard.sendKeyStroke(KEY_R, MOD_GUI_LEFT);
  DigiKeyboard.delay(300);
  // Open "cmd"
  DigiKeyboard.print("cmd /k cd %UserProfile%/Desktop");
  DigiKeyboard.sendKeyStroke(KEY_ENTER);
  DigiKeyboard.delay(300);
  // Create the file
  DigiKeyboard.print("echo You have been digisparked :v > digisparked.txt");
  DigiKeyboard.sendKeyStroke(KEY_ENTER);
  DigiKeyboard.delay(300);
  // Close "cmd"
  DigiKeyboard.print("exit");
  DigiKeyboard.sendKeyStroke(KEY_ENTER);
  DigiKeyboard.delay(300);
  // Wait
  for (;;) {
    // To wait until the Digispark gets pulled out of the computer
  }
}
```

What this is going to do is simulate that you press WinKey+R, open "*cmd*" and create a file on the desktop named digisparked.txt.

Go to "*Tools*" -> "*Port*" and select the serial port that appears in the drop down menu. It usually is "*COM0*" or "*COM1*".

Now click the "*Upload*" button and stick the *Digispark* in a *USB* port within the next 60 seconds. It will flash the code into the *Digispark*.

**Now you can plug your *Digispark*, sit back, and get Digisparked!**

As you can see, it only takes about 2 seconds to get the job done.

## Common errors
If you get this error when compiling the code:
```
"DigiKeyboard.h: No such file or directory"
```
Your board was likely changed in the settings when the *Arduino IDE* was reopened.

Go back to "*Tools*" -> "*Board*" and select "*Digispark (Default - 16.5mhz)*"

## Extra
There is a *GitHub* project named ["*Duckyspark*"](https://github.com/toxydose/Duckyspark) that converts *.duck* scripts to the *.ino* format that our *Digispark* understands. It's written in *python3* and works well.

The syntax is as shown below:
```bash
python3 Duckyspark_translator.py <rubber ducky file> <digispark file>
```

With it, you can take any *.duck* script and use it on your *Digispark*!

## More extra
There is a *GitHub* project named ["*Duck2spark*"](https://github.com/mame82/duck2spark) that works somewhat like the previous tool, but this one takes the output of [*Duckencoder*](https://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky/blob/master/Encoder/encoder.jar) (which supports different types of keyboard layouts) and converts it to an Arduino Sketch that you can upload to your *Digispark*.

## Even more extra
If you want to go deep into this, here is a link to the "*digikeyboard.h*" file in the official GitHub project of digistump:
```
https://github.com/digistump/DigisparkArduinoIntegration/blob/master/libraries/DigisparkKeyboard/DigiKeyboard.h
```

And here is a link to the official "*HID usage tables*":
```

```

And last, this webpage contains lots of *.duck* scripts that you can translate to *Digispark* using the *Duckyspark* tool:
