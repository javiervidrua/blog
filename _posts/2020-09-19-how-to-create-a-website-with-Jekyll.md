 Well, if you want to create a website like [**this one**](https://javiervidrua.github.io), all you have to do is:
1. Install **Jekyll** on your machine, from [**here**](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).
1. Run these commands:
   ```bash
   jekyll new mywebpage
   cd mywebpage
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```

Navigate to `localhost:4000` from your browser, **and you should see your new website**!

If you edit something and want to rebuild your site, open the terminal and run `bundle exec jekyll build`
