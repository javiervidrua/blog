If you are a developer, you should learn *software versioning*, so your products follow the naming conventions and it is easy to track dependencies.

That said, I recommend you learn [**Semantic Versioning 2.0.0**](https://semver.org/).

All you have to do to learn it is read the webpage provided above, and **in 15 minutes** you will be good to go!
